# Tetris (Code-along Project)

## What is this app about?

It's a Tetris game.

## What did I learn?

I followed a code-along from a Youtube video to learn how to write code, and getting a better grasp of React - how it works.
I got a better understanding of the coding environment, and learned a little about Hooks and Components.
After finishing the code along I did my own tweaks to the game, mostly CSS styling.
